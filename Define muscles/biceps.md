# Biceps Traning Something else 
This is a 60 minutes biceps training course that will help you build strength and size in your arms. You will need a pair of dumbbells, a barbell, and a preacher bench for this course. Here are the exercises, repetitions, and sets you will do:

This is a different line 

1. Dumbbell curl: This exercise strengthens the biceps brachii, the main muscle of the upper arm. Hold a dumbbell in each hand, with your palms facing up and your arms hanging by your sides. Curl the dumbbells up to your shoulders, keeping your elbows close to your body. Squeeze your biceps at the top, then lower the dumbbells back to the starting position. Repeat for 12 repetitions, then rest for 90 seconds. Do 3 sets of this exercise.
2. Barbell curl: This exercise works the biceps brachii and the brachialis, a muscle that lies beneath the biceps. Hold a barbell with an underhand grip, with your hands shoulder-width apart and your arms extended in front of you. Curl the barbell up to your chest, keeping your elbows close to your body. Squeeze your biceps at the top, then lower the barbell back to the starting position. Repeat for 10 repetitions, then rest for 90 seconds. Do 3 sets of this exercise.
3. Preacher curl: This exercise isolates the biceps brachii and prevents cheating by locking your elbows in place. Sit on a preacher bench and place your upper arms on the padded support. Hold a dumbbell in each hand, with your palms facing up and your arms fully stretched. Curl the dumbbells up to your forehead, keeping your upper arms still. Squeeze your biceps at the top, then lower the dumbbells back to the starting position. Repeat for 8 repetitions, then rest for 90 seconds. Do 3 sets of this exercise.

This is the end of the 60 minutes biceps training course. You should feel a good pump in your arms and a sense of accomplishment. Remember to stretch your biceps after the workout and drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.
