This is a 60 minutes breast training course that aims to strengthen and tone the chest muscles. The course consists of four exercises: push-ups, chest presses, chest flies, and cable crossovers. Each exercise has a different number of repetitions and sets, depending on the difficulty level and the desired intensity. Here is the breakdown of the course:

- Push-ups: This is a basic exercise that works the chest, shoulders, and triceps. To perform a push-up, place your hands on the floor slightly wider than your shoulders, and keep your body in a straight line from head to toe. Lower your chest to the floor, then push yourself back up. Repeat for 15 to 20 repetitions, and do 3 sets with a 60-second rest between each set.
- Chest presses: This is an exercise that targets the chest, shoulders, and triceps. To perform a chest press, lie on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand. Hold the dumbbells at chest level, with your palms facing away from you. Press the dumbbells up over your chest, then lower them back to the starting position. Repeat for 12 to 15 repetitions, and do 3 sets with a 60-second rest between each set.
- Chest flies: This is an exercise that isolates the chest muscles. To perform a chest fly, lie on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand. Extend your arms out to the sides, with your palms facing each other. Keeping your elbows slightly bent, bring the dumbbells together over your chest, then lower them back to the starting position. Repeat for 10 to 12 repetitions, and do 3 sets with a 60-second rest between each set.
- Cable crossovers: This is an exercise that works the inner chest and the front deltoids. To perform a cable crossover, stand between two cable pulleys with a handle attached to each one. Hold the handles at shoulder level, with your palms facing down. Keeping your arms slightly bent, bring the handles together in front of your chest, then return to the starting position. Repeat for 8 to 10 repetitions, and do 3 sets with a 60-second rest between each set.

This is the end of the breast training course. You should feel your chest muscles burning and pumped up after completing this workout. Make sure to stretch and hydrate after the session.
