If you want to build bigger and stronger biceps, you need to follow a training course that challenges your muscles with enough volume and intensity. Here is a sample biceps training course that you can try to maximize your strength.

- Start with a warm-up of 10 minutes of cardio and some light stretching.
- Perform 3 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions of barbell curls, resting 90 seconds between sets. This exercise targets the long head of the biceps, which is responsible for the peak of the muscle.
- Perform 3 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions of hammer curls, resting 90 seconds between sets. This exercise targets the brachialis, which is a muscle that lies beneath the biceps and adds thickness to the arm.
- Perform 3 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions of incline dumbbell curls, resting 90 seconds between sets. This exercise targets the short head of the biceps, which is responsible for the width of the muscle.
- Finish with a cool-down of 10 minutes of cardio and some light stretching.

This biceps training course should be done once or twice a week, depending on your recovery and goals. You can also vary the exercises, weights, and reps to keep your muscles guessing and growing. Remember to eat enough protein and carbs to fuel your workouts and repair your muscles.
